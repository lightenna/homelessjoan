Aims to be an up-to-date directory of services and interventions - powered by twitter to keep the data relevant (@HomelessJoan)
 
The directory is aimed at help-givers (charities, public services) to find relevant referals for those at risk of becoming homeless.
* In the charity sector, funding starts and stops. 
** This means keeping up to date with which services are available is tough. 
* Personal relationships are the primary method of communication, rather than an official communication network.
