Aims to be an up-to-date directory of services and interventions - powered by twitter to keep the data relevant (@HomelessJoan)

The directory is aimed at help-givers (charities, public services) to find relevant referals for those at risk of becoming homeless, and to allow them to keep their offerings up to date.
* In the charity sector, funding starts and stops.
  * This means *keeping up to date with which services are available is tough.*
* Personal relationships are the primary method of discovering updates, rather than an official communication network.
* Different care services specialise in different clients
  * because knowledge and care needs to be personalised to the end-user
  * because the problem is so varied



# Our Vision

We believe it is far more effective to prevent homeless at the earliest possible point when life event sets someone on the path to homelessness. This is cheaper, less time consuming and ultimately more effective than helping someone once they have become homeless - dealing with the causes rather than the fallout.

# What we hacked

# Hoped next steps

* A directory of help services is created. With details of:
  * What help is offered
  * Who can access the help
  * Who to contact
* This directory is super easy to update
  * Largest focus on turning off unavailable services, so that the vulnerable don't have a negative experience from being turned away
* Caregivers can query the directory to find the relevant personalised services for their client
* Caregivers can see new services that are offered - so can spend less time advertising their own services
